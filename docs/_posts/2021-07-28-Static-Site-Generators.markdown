author: "Rich Ross"
description: Static Site Generators are a great way to build a website that is based more on content.  While you could build any type of site, it's perfect for blogs, documentation, books, and content-heavy sites.<br><br>In this show we talked about using a static site generator to build a content site without the hassle of writing and maintaining several pages of html and css layout.<br><br>You can also easily host a site that uses Jekyll on GitHub Pages because support is built right in.  IT doesn't mean you can't host any static site with GitHub Pages.  You can use your favorite tools.
