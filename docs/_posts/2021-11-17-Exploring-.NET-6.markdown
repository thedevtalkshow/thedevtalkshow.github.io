title: Exploring .NET 6 LIVE - Post .NET Conf Wrap Up
author: Rich Ross
description: ".NET 6 was released at .NET Conf 2021 and we're going to talk about new features, try it out live, and maybe explore some new features in IDEs that go with it.  There's been a lot going on in this space and after .NET Conf we'll have plenty of thoughts about it.<br><br>
We'd also love to know what you think and can't wait to hear your ideas for what we should try.  We love to explore things live and learn together.<br><br> .NET Conf 2021 is November 9-11: https://www.dotnetconf.net/."
